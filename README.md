# K-Dense BYOK

**Your own AI research assistant, running on your computer, powered by your API keys.**

K-Dense BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) is an open-source app that lets you chat with an AI assistant called **Kady**. You ask Kady a question or give it a task, and it figures out the best way to handle it — sometimes answering directly, sometimes spinning up specialized AI "experts" that work behind the scenes to get you a thorough result.

It's built for scientists, analysts, and curious people who want a powerful AI workspace without being locked into a single provider. K-Dense BYOK is powered by our very popular Claude Scientific Skills.

> **Beta:** K-Dense BYOK is currently in beta. Many features and performance improvements are on the way in the coming weeks. [Star us on GitHub](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok) to stay in the loop, and follow us on [X](https://x.com/k_dense_ai), [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/company/k-dense-inc), and [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@K-Dense-Inc) for release notes and tutorial videos.

## What can it do?

- **Answer questions and complete tasks** — Ask Kady anything. For complex work, it delegates to AI experts that each have their own specialties (bioinformatics, finance, data analysis, etc.) with full access to our 170+ scientific skills.
- **Search the web** — Kady can look things up online and pull in live information while working on your request.
- **Work with your files** — Upload files, create new ones, and preview them right in the app. Everything stays in a local sandbox folder on your machine. Can handle almost any file type.
- **Access 250+ scientific databases and 500k+ Python packages** — Kady's experts come pre-loaded with specialized scientific skills from [K-Dense](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI), covering everything from genomics to materials science.
- **Choose your AI model** — Pick from 40+ models (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, xAI, Qwen, and more) through a simple dropdown in the app. You're not stuck with one.
- **326 ready-to-use workflows** — Browse a built-in library of workflow templates spanning 22 disciplines — from genomics and drug discovery to finance and astrophysics. Pick a workflow, fill in the variables, select a model, and launch. Each workflow comes with curated skill suggestions so the agent knows exactly which tools to reach for. Workflows that need uploaded data are clearly marked, and you can upload files directly from the launch dialog.
- **Run heavy computations remotely** — Optionally connect [Modal](https://modal.com/) to run demanding workloads on powerful cloud hardware instead of your laptop.

> **Note:** The model you select in the dropdown only applies to Kady (the main agent). Expert execution and coding tasks use the Gemini CLI, which always runs through a Gemini model on [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) regardless of your dropdown selection.

## What you'll need before starting

| What | Why | Where to get it |
|------|-----|-----------------|
| A computer running **macOS or Linux** | The app runs locally on your machine | Windows works too — just use [WSL](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) |
| An **OpenRouter API key** | This is how the AI models are accessed | [openrouter.ai](https://openrouter.ai/) — sign up and create a key |
| A **Parallel API key** *(optional)* | Lets Kady search the web | [parallel.ai](https://parallel.ai/) |
| **Modal** credentials *(optional)* | Only needed if you want remote compute for heavy jobs | [modal.com](https://modal.com/) |

That's it. The startup script handles installing everything else automatically.

## Getting started

### Step 1 — Download the project

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/k-dense-byok.git
cd k-dense-byok
```

### Step 2 — Add your API key

Create a file called `.env` inside the `kady_agent` folder with this content:

```env
# Your OpenRouter API key (required)
OPENROUTER_API_KEY=paste-your-key-here

# Enables web search (optional)
PARALLEL_API_KEY=paste-your-key-here

# Leave these as-is — they connect internal services
GOOGLE_GEMINI_BASE_URL=http://localhost:4000
GEMINI_API_KEY=sk-litellm-local

# The default AI model Kady uses (you can change this in the app later)
DEFAULT_AGENT_MODEL=openrouter/google/gemini-3.1-pro-preview

# Remote compute — only fill in if you have a Modal account (optional)
MODAL_TOKEN_ID=
MODAL_TOKEN_SECRET=
```

At minimum, you need to fill in `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`. Everything else is optional or should be left as-is.

### Step 3 — Start the app

```bash
chmod +x start.sh
./start.sh
```

The first time you run this, it will automatically install any missing tools (Python packages, Node.js, Gemini CLI) and download scientific skills. This may take a few minutes. After that, future starts will be much faster.

Once everything is running, your browser will open to **[http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)** — that's the app.

To stop everything, press **Ctrl+C** in the terminal.

## How it works (the short version)

The app runs three services on your computer:

| Service | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Frontend** (port 3000) | The web interface you interact with — chat, file browser, and file preview side by side |
| **Backend** (port 8000) | The brain — runs Kady and coordinates expert tasks |
| **LiteLLM proxy** (port 4000) | A translator that routes your AI requests to whichever model you've chosen via [OpenRouter](https://openrouter.ai/) |

When you send a message, Kady reads it, decides whether to answer directly or delegate to an expert, uses any needed tools (web search, file operations, scientific databases), and streams the response back to you.

## Project layout

├── server.py             ← Backend server

└── sandbox/              ← Workspace for files and expert tasks (created on first run)
```

## Why "BYOK"?

BYOK stands for **Bring Your Own Keys**. Instead of paying a subscription to a single AI company, you plug in API keys from whatever providers you prefer. You stay in control of which models you use, how much you spend, and where your data goes.

## Contributing workflows

The workflow library lives in a single JSON file at `web/src/data/workflows.json`. Adding or improving a workflow is one of the easiest ways to contribute to the project.

### Workflow structure

Each workflow is a JSON object with these fields:

```json
{
  "id": "unique-kebab-case-id",
  "name": "Human-Readable Name",
  "description": "One-sentence summary shown on the card",
  "category": "genomics",
  "icon": "Dna",
  "prompt": "Detailed instructions with {placeholder} syntax for user variables",
  "suggestedSkills": ["scanpy", "scientific-visualization"],
  "placeholders": [
    { "key": "placeholder", "label": "What to ask the user", "required": true }
  ],
  "requiresFiles": true
}
```

Set `requiresFiles` to `true` when the workflow needs user-uploaded data (datasets, manuscripts, images, etc.). These workflows display a "Files" badge on the card and show an upload button in the launch dialog so users can add files to the sandbox before running.

### How to add a workflow

1. Open `web/src/data/workflows.json`.
2. Add your workflow object anywhere in the array (it will be grouped by `category` automatically).
3. Pick a `category` from the existing 22 disciplines (`paper`, `visual`, `data`, `literature`, `grants`, `scicomm`, `genomics`, `proteomics`, `cellbio`, `chemistry`, `drugdiscovery`, `physics`, `materials`, `clinical`, `neuro`, `ecology`, `finance`, `social`, `math`, `ml`, `engineering`, `astro`) or propose a new one.
4. Choose an `icon` name from [Lucide Icons](https://lucide.dev/icons/) (PascalCase, no "Icon" suffix — e.g. `FlaskConical`, `Brain`, `Dna`). If the icon isn't already imported in `workflows-panel.tsx`, add it there too.
5. List `suggestedSkills` from the [K-Dense scientific skills](https://github.com/K-Dense-AI/claude-scientific-skills) — these are passed to the agent so it knows which tools to load. Only use skill IDs that exist in the repo.
6. Use `{placeholder}` syntax in the prompt for any variable the user should fill in, and add a matching entry in `placeholders`.

### Tips for high-quality workflows

- Write prompts with **numbered steps** so the agent follows a clear procedure.
- Include 2–5 `suggestedSkills` — enough to be helpful, not so many that they dilute focus.
- Mark placeholders as `"required": true` only when the workflow genuinely can't run without them.
- Keep descriptions under ~120 characters so they display well on the card.

Submit your addition as a pull request. We review and merge workflow contributions quickly.
